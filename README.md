# Prohibition Virtual Tour

Prohibition was the banning of alchohol during the 1920s and this walks people through the problems, what happened, but mostly the problems

## Files

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `start.html`: This is a relatively simple html file just containing the button to enter the tour. The styling itself is in the style.css file

← `style.css`: This is linked to the start.html file. It creates the style for the beginning view of the site

← `script.js`: This adds interactivity to start.html and switches it the the "entrance hall" (entrance.html)

← `HIWE.html`: This stands for how it was ended. It is a seperate html file because there are no buttons so it is a simply href.location = "" 

← `entrance.html`: This is where everything happens. I opted to have one or two html files with hidden content that becomes unhidden but buttons are click. This does make it more messy but it much better that having 10 different html files in my opinion. <br>** Note:** Because of the nature of the prohibition area the names are long so much of it is abbreviated. Above each abbreviation will be a comment describing what is stands for.

← `museumScript.js`: This is the main part of the program. The main idea is hiding and unhiding the elements of "entrance.html". 

← `sources.html`: This is a basic html document designed to show the websites historical sources very basically. The sources here must be in MLA format.

← `museumStyle.css`: This the main style sheet for the "entrance.html" file and the "HIWE.html" file
