            <h1>The Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform</h1>
            <p>
                Founded in 1929 by Pauline Sabin the WONPR was founded to argue for the repeal of national prohibition. They believed that it was wrong to outlaw prohibition when there was an "American principle of local home rule." They also wanted to repeal it because
                of the disastrous effect it had on crime in America. Organized crime had skyrocketed and with it corruption. Another thing that the WONPR challenged was the idea that all women supported prohibition.

            <h1>Women's Christian Temperance Union</h1>
            <p>
                The Women's Christian Temperance Union was an organization run by women focused on a variety of issues. During the 1920s the main issue was Prohibition. They argued for the enactment of prohibition laws. They would hold peaceful protests. They would pray
                outside of local saloons and in three months they had made 250 communities stop drinking liquor. This was very influential because this type of thing hadn't really been seen before and it showed what they could accomplish as a group.

            <h1>The Anti-Saloon League</h1>
            <p>
                The Anti-Saloon league, led by Wayne Wheeler, advocated for Prohibition and fought with anti-prohibiton groups once prohibition was enacted. While prohibition did not have the effect Wheeler probably wanted but he continued arguing for it fiercely. A
                big way they made people join their side is by the use patriotism. Many breweries were german and WW1 brewed anti-german sentiment. Wheeler used that to his advantage to connect the two and argue that drinking was unpatriotic.

        <div id="curruption">
            <h1>Curruption during prohibition</h1>
            <p>
                One Main reason that Prohibition was such a failure was the enourmous amount of curruption, in the government, and in organizations like the police department. Prohibition and Police agents became extremely currupt because bootleggers could easily bribe
                them and some of these agents were actually tempted to go into bootlegging theirselves. Of course there were many who stayed loyal but enough became currupt that people lost trust in law enforcement.

        <!--Problems with Enforcement-->
        <div id="enforce">
            <h1>Prohibition was impossible to enforce</h1>
            <p>
                Prohibition, was essentially impossible to enforce because of the sheer amount of people bootlegging. There were also many loopholes in both the 18th Amendment, and the Volstead Ac. One such loophole was the problem that Manufacturing, Sale, and Transportation.
                The Volstead Act which helped try to enforce Prohibition also had many loopholes. One such loophole was that alchohol could still be made and given for medical and religious purposes. Because of this the amount of pharmacists trippled
                and more and more people became rabbis which meant they could recieve wine.

        <!--Organized Crime-->
        <div id="ocrime">
            <h1>Huge increase in organized crime</h1>
            <p>
                Because of the outlawing of liquor bootleggers became extremely successful and the people who capitalized on this were mainly Crime Organizations. The Image of Al Capone was formed during this time as he was a major figure in Crime and Bootlegging. Gangs
                formed complex networks of manufacturing and distribution and used curruption to keep their businesses up. Al Capone himself became popular because he loved media attention. He embodied what the public though as a daring an adventurous
                life but in reality he was extremly brutal. He would order assassinations and hits on his rivals. In the end he was ironically brought down for tax evasion.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="lasdiv">
            <h1>Law against Sale</h1>
            <p>
                The 18th Amendment had many Loopholes, partially because while the sale, manufacturing, and distribution of Liquor was illegal, the consumption of it was not. This led to things like grape concentrate which had a warning that said don't leave it on the
                counter for a long period of time because it would turn into wine. At home they were producing liquor but it was not technically being sold. So the company itself was legally in the right even if the people themselves were not.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="latdiv">
            <h1>Law against Transportation</h1>
            <p>
                The 18th Amendment Prohibited the transportation of liquor. This was effective however very quickly organized crime gangs formed networks to transport their liquor to speakeasies and other clients.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="lamdiv">
            <h1>Law againt Manufacture</h1>
            <p>
                Obviously a main part of the law was that you could not manufacture liquor. However this did not just apply to big breweries but also everybody. Moonshining and other tactics were done by citizens and because of this millions became criminals and the
                justice system had a huge backlog of cases. Judges had to use plea bargains to clear hundreds of cases quickly.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="HIWEdiv">
            <h1>How was Prohibition Ended?</h1>
            <p>
                Prohibitions end had really been coming ever since it was enacted because nearly everyone despised it. It had caused extreme increase in crime, had made millions of people criminals and tanked the economy because it took away jobs from people because
                breweries were shut down. When the Great Depression occured people blamed Prohibition which caused it to become even more unpopular. The Anti-Saloon League lost it's power and polls showed people wanted prohibition to be repealed. There
                was a new election coming and Franklin Roosevelt, a popular candidate, was heavily anti-prohibition. Pauline Sabin, leader of the WONPR, the Womens Organization for National Prohibition Reform, gave Roosevelt her support which encouraged
                millions of her followers to vote for him. Roosevelt won in a landslide and he immediately began working to stop prohibiton. The 21st Amendment was signed into action on march 22nd 1933.
