    <h1>How was Prohibition Ended?</h1>
    <p>
        Prohibitions end had really been coming ever since it was enacted because nearly everyone despised it. It had caused extreme increase in crime, had made millions of people criminals and tanked the economy because it took away jobs from people because
        breweries were shut down. When the Great Depression occured people blamed Prohibition which caused it to become even more unpopular. The Anti-Saloon League lost it's power and polls showed people wanted prohibition to be repealed. There was a
        new election coming and Franklin Roosevelt, a popular candidate, was heavily anti-prohibition. Pauline Sabin, leader of the WONPR, the Womens Organization for National Prohibition Reform, gave Roosevelt her support which encouraged millions of
        her followers to vote for him. Roosevelt won in a landslide and he immediately began working to stop prohibiton. The 21st Amendment was signed into action on march 22nd 1933.
